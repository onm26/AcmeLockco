Website Proposal
This proposal is a full redesign and rebuild of the Acme Lock Company website. The current site was built on the Thryv platform. It uses a dated template and offers limited customization options. I believe it could use a modern web design look. The new website will be built from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This ensures full control over design, layout, and functionality.
The purpose of this rebuild is to present Acme Lock Company as a premium and trusted locksmith service provider. The website will highlight its residential, commercial, automotive, and emergency locksmith services. The site will provide contact methods, service details, and designed with a mobile friendly approach for users searching on smartphones. The rebuild will start with an HTML5 boilerplate template, giving the site a well-structured foundation for adding responsive layouts, CSS styling and JavaScript capabilities. Using HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap ensures that a website is mobile-first, accessible, and flexible across devices. This aligns with best practices in modern web development. 

Target Audience
Primary audience for the site includes:
•	Residential locksmith services such as lockouts, rekeying, or smart lock installation.
•	Commercial solutions like master key systems, security upgrades, and access control.
•	Vehicle owners requiring services like car key replacements or lockouts.

Functionality
The website will deliver the following functionality:
•	A mobile responsive design using Bootstrap grid and flexible layouts for consistent display across devices.
•	Navigation bar for easy access to main sections (Home, Services, Reviews, About, Contact).
•	Click-to-call phone links and integrated Google Maps for easy customer action.
•	Service icons to visually present different locksmith services.
•	Accessibility features like semantic HTML, alt text for images, and sufficient color contrast to meet WCAG standards.

Design Layout
The website will follow a Swiss Style with a modern flat design approach that will improve user experience and visual appeal. This design style will make the website look highly professional while improving user experience on both desktop and mobile.
Design details:
•	Colors: White background with light and dark blue text, accents, and call-to-action buttons. 
•	Typography: Helvetica or sans-serif font.
•	Flat design features will be solid-color buttons and icons. 
•	Images: Professional service photos.
